      <h1> About Bloopers </h1>

      <div class="about-info">

        <p>
          <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right"></span> A <b>blooper</b> is a short sequence of a film or video production, usually a deleted scene, containing a mistake made by a member of the cast or crew.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right"></span> <b>Bloopers</b> are often the subject of television programs or are occasionally revealed during the credit sequence at the end of films (Jackie Chan and Burt Reynolds are both famous for including such reels with the closing credits of their movies). Humorous mistakes made by athletes are often referred to as bloopers as well, particularly in baseball.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-hand-right"></span> In recent years, many CGI-animated films have also incorporated <b>bloopers</b> including a mix of faked bloopers, genuine voice-actor mistakes set to animation, and technical errors. Examples can be found in A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc., Valiant, some Barbie films and the Indian film Roadside Romeo.<br>
